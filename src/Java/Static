Where can you use static?
Use Case	    Example Syntax	                Meaning
Static Variable	static int count;	            Shared across all objects (like a global for the class)
Static Method	static void utility()	        Can be called without an object (e.g., Math.max())
Static Block	static { ...}                   Runs once when class is loaded (used for initialization)
Static Class	static class Nested { ... }	    Inner class that doesn’t need access to outer class's instance fields

1. Can static methods be overridden?
Trick Question!
➡ No, static methods can be hidden, but not overridden in the traditional polymorphic sense.

🔍 Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Parent {
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();  // this is runtime polymorphism
        p.greet(); // Output: Hello from Parent ❗ Not Child
    }
}
🧠 Why? Because static methods are resolved at compile-time, not runtime.

Can we access static variables inside non-static methods and vice versa?
✅ You can access static variables from non-static methods (since they belong to the class).

❌ You cannot access non-static variables inside a static method directly.

Can a class be static?
✅ Inner classes can be static (called static nested classes).

❌ Top-level classes (outermost ones) cannot be static.

Why use static nested classes?
To group classes logically and save memory when the nested class doesn’t need access to outer class instance.

java
Copy
Edit
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void print() {
            System.out.println("Static inner class");
        }
    }
}

Can we use this inside a static method?
❌ No. this refers to the current object, and static methods do not belong to any object.

Is static memory shared across different classloaders?
❌ No. Static variables are not shared across different classloaders.
Static variables are shared per ClassLoader.

If the same class is loaded by different classloaders, they’ll each have their own copy of static variables.

🧠 Use Case: Web apps on same server can load same classes in different contexts (isolation via classloaders).

Singleton Pattern Using Static
class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
