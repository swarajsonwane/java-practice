Builder patterns -
Pattern used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects

when you want to build an object made up from other objects
when you want the creation of these parts to be independent of the main object
Hide the creation of the parts from the client so both arent dependent
The builder knows the specifics and nobody else does

Event Based Architecture -

Do not directly interact with services instead stays in event bus like structure
Service consumes event and check if its relevant
e.g Git , React , Node.js
Publisher and Subscriber model
Availability - each of services can store event data in local db because services dont need to be dependent
on other service for information about events
 - benefits - easy rollback/ move to point in history
 - Replacement - easy to replace services
 - Transaction gauranty
 - Store Intent of the data while storing events

 Disadvantages-
 - Consistency
 - N/A to Gateway
 - Lesser Control with req and response
 - Hidden flow - like service1 sents out events to events bus then what other services do with it is unknow
 - Migration
